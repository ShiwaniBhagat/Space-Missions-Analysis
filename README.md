# Space-Missions-Analysis
Welcome to the **Space Missions Launch Analysis Project**! This project presents a comprehensive exploration of a synthetic dataset simulating historical space launches from various countries and companies. Using Python data science libraries, we investigate mission trends, success rates, launch costs, and more through visualizations and statistical summaries.
# Project Description
The Space Missions Launch Analysis project is a data analysis and visualization exploration of a synthetic dataset that simulates global space missions. It investigates how space exploration has evolved over time, which countries and companies dominate launches, and how factors such as cost, rocket types, and mission outcomes influence the success of launches.

Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy, this project dives deep into understanding trends, distributions, and correlations in space mission data. It includes visual insights through bar charts, pie charts, violin plots, and scatter plots, covering everything from launch frequency and mission success rates to cost analysis and rocket usage.

The aim is to gain insights into the operational patterns of the space industry, simulate real-world data science workflows, and create an engaging, educational analytical project suitable for academic or portfolio use.
